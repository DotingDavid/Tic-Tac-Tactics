Bomb: When a player uses the Bomb option, they can select any square on the board and erase that square and its three adjacent squares (forming a 2x2 square) from the game. This can be a powerful tool for disrupting the opponent's patterns or creating new opportunities for the player's own marks. However, since the Bomb only affects adjacent squares, it may not always be the best option for strategic play.

Mallet: When a player uses the Mallet option, they can select any square on the board and remove that square from the game. This can be a useful tool for disrupting the opponent's strategy or creating openings for the player's own marks. However, since the Mallet can only remove one square at a time, it may not always be the most efficient option for strategic play.

Line Eraser: When a player uses the Line Eraser option, they can select any row or column on the board and remove all of the squares in that row or column from the game. This can be a powerful tool for clearing a path to victory or limiting the opponent's options. However, since the Line Eraser affects a whole row or column, it may not always be the best option for targeted disruption.

Freeze: When a player uses the Freeze option, they can select any square on the board and prevent the opponent from placing a mark in that square for the next two turns. This can be a strategic way to limit the opponent's options and control the board. However, since the Freeze only affects one square at a time and has a limited duration, it may not always be the most powerful option for strategic play.
